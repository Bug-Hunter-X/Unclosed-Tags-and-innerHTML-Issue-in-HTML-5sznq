This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML bug related to using innerHTML and potentially unclosed tags.  The bug.html file contains the erroneous code, while solution.html provides a corrected version. The primary issue arises from how innerHTML handles malformed or nested tags within the injected content, leading to unpredictable rendering outcomes or potential XSS vulnerabilities if user input is involved.
